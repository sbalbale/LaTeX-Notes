\section{Build-a-Graph}

\subsection{Acyclic Graph Where Every Pair of Nodes Has an Edge}
This graph does not exist. An acyclic graph cannot have an edge between every pair of nodes, as this would necessarily create cycles among the nodes.

\subsection{Rooted Tree Where \( B \) is the Root}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [every node/.style={circle, draw, minimum size=1cm, inner sep=2pt}]
  \node (B) {$B_{root}$};
  \node (A) [below left=of B] {A};
  \node (C) [below=of B] {C};
  \node (D) [below right=of B] {D};
  \node (E) [right=of D] {E};
  
  \draw (B) -- (A);
  \draw (B) -- (C);
  \draw (B) -- (D);
  \draw (B) -- (E);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
This structure satisfies the acyclic and tree properties, with \( B \) designated as the root node.

\subsection{Graph with No Cycles That is Not a Tree}
A forest (a set of disjoint trees) meets this criterion. For example, with nodes \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \), we could have two disjoint trees, such as \( A - B \), \( C - D \), and \(E\), which is a graph without cycles and that is not a single tree.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [every node/.style={circle, draw, minimum size=1cm, inner sep=2pt}]
  \node (A) {A};
  \node (B) [right=of A] {B};
  \node (C) [right=1.5cm of B] {C};
  \node (D) [right=of C] {D};

  \node (E) [right= 1.5cm of D] {E};
  
  \draw (A) -- (B);
  \draw (C) -- (D);
  \draw (E);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Alternatively we could use a directed graph with nodes \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \) and edges \( A \rightarrow B \), \( B \rightarrow C \), \( C \rightarrow D \), and \( D \rightarrow E \), which is acyclic but not a tree.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[->, >=stealth, node distance=1.5cm, 
                        every node/.style={circle, draw, minimum size=1cm, inner sep=2pt}]
      
      % Nodes
      \node (A) {A};
      \node (B) [right=of A] {B};
      \node (C) [right=of B] {C};
      \node (D) [right=of C] {D};
      \node (E) [right=of D] {E};
      
      % Directed Edges
      \draw (A) -> (B);
      \draw (B) -> (C);
      \draw (C) -> (D);
      \draw (D) -> (E);
    
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\subsection{Weighted Graph Where Every Path from \( A \) to \( E \) Has Weight 2}
Consider a graph with paths \( A - B - E \), \( A - D - E \), and \( A - C - E \), where each edge has a weight of 1. Both paths from \( A \) to \( E \) thus have a total weight of 2, satisfying the condition.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      % Set up nodes
      [every node/.style={circle,draw, minimum size=1cm, inner sep=2pt}]
      
      \node (A) at (0,2) {A};
      \node (B) at (3,4) {B};
      \node (C) at (3,2) {C};
      \node (D) at (3,0) {D};
      \node (E) at (6,2) {E};
      
      % Draw edges with weights
      \draw (A) -- node[draw=none, above] {1} (B);
      \draw (A) -- node[draw=none, above] {1} (C);
      \draw (A) -- node[draw=none, above] {1} (D);
      \draw (B) -- node[draw=none, above] {1} (E);
      \draw (C) -- node[draw=none, above] {1} (E);
      \draw (D) -- node[draw=none, above] {1} (E);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

\subsection{Rooted Tree with Minimal Number of Leafs}
To minimize the number of leaf nodes in a rooted tree of 5 nodes, we arrange the nodes in a straight line where each node connects to exactly one other, except the root. For example:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [every node/.style={circle, draw, minimum size=1cm, inner sep=2pt}]
  \node (B) {B};
  \node (C) [below=of B] {C};
  \node (D) [below=of C] {D};
  \node (E) [below=of D] {E};
  \node (F) [below=of E] {F};
  
  \draw (B) -- (C) -- (D) -- (E) -- (F);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
This structure has only one leaf node \( F \), which minimizes the number of leaves.

\subsection{Strongly Connected Directed Graph with 5 Nodes with Minimal Edges}
To form a strongly connected directed graph with 5 nodes and the minimum number of edges, we create a directed cycle among the nodes: \( A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow E \rightarrow A \). This configuration has exactly 5 edges, ensuring strong connectivity.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->, >=stealth, auto, node distance=2cm, every node/.style={circle, draw}]
  \node (A) {A};
  \node (B) [right=of A] {B};
  \node (C) [right=of B] {C};
  \node (D) [below=of C] {D};
  \node (E) [below=of B] {E};

  \draw (A) -- (B);
  \draw (B) -- (C);
  \draw (C) -- (D);
  \draw (D) -- (E);
  \draw (E) -- (A);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The descendents of \( B \) are all nodes below it in the tree: \( A, D, C, \) and \( E \).

\subsection{Neighbors of \( D \) or \( G \) Not Also Neighbors of \( B \)}
The neighbors of \( D \) are \( B \), $F$ and \( E \), and the neighbors of \( G \) are \( D \), $I$ and \( F \). Excluding neighbors of \( B \), which are $A$ and $D$, the nodes satisfying this condition are $E$, \( F \) and $I$.

\section{Extra Credit: Airline Connectivity}

Given a graph representing flights among cities, if every pair of cities is connected by exactly one airline, there exists at least one airline that can connect any two cities via a sequence of flights, thus forming a connected graph for that airline.
