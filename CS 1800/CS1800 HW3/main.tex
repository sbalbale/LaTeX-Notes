\section*{Problem 1: Beatles Set Representation}

Given:
\[
A = \{paul, george\}, \quad B = \{ringo, george\}, \quad U = \{john, paul, ringo, george\}
\]

Bit string representation:
\[
A = 0 1 0 1, \quad B = 0 0 1 1
\]

\subsection*{i. \( A \cup B \) (Union)}
Union of two sets is represented using the OR operator:
\[
A \cup B = 0 1 1 1 \quad (\text{OR})
\]

\subsection*{ii. \( A \cap B \) (Intersection)}
Intersection of two sets is represented using the AND operator:
\[
A \cap B = 0 0 0 1 \quad (\text{AND})
\]

\subsection*{iii. \( A^C \) (Complement of A)}
The complement of A is represented using the NOT operator:
\[
A^C = 1 0 1 0 \quad (\text{NOT})
\]

Subtracting 1 from each element in \(A\):
\[
\{1, 3, 5, 7\}
\]

\subsection*{ii. \( \{x \in B \mid x \text{ is even}\} \)}
Since no element in \(B\) is even:
\[
\emptyset

\subsection*{iii. \( \{x \in A \mid x + 3 \in U \} \)}
Checking elements in \(A\) for which \(x + 3\) is in \(U\):
\[
\{2, 4, 6\}

No common elements between \(A\) and \(B\):
\[
A \cap B = \emptyset
\]

\subsection*{v. \( A \cup B \)}

\[
A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8\}

\]

\subsection*{vii. \( (A \cap B^C)^C \)}
Finding the complement of \(B\) in \(U\), intersecting with \(A\), and then taking the complement:
\[
(A \cap B^C)^C = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}
\]

\subsection*{viii. \( A \triangle B \)}
The symmetric difference between \(A\) and \(B\):
\[

\section*{Problem 3: Set Operations (Shading)}

For this problem, the regions of the Venn diagrams are shaded based on the following set expressions:

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5, transform shape]
    %% You can adjust the opacity here. For venn diagrams it is convenient to have a low opacity so that you can see intersections
        \begin{scope} [fill opacity = 0.4]
    %% The draw command knows a lot of shapes. To make a rectangle you just need to specify two diagonal corners. Make sure you always have a semicolon at the end of your draw commands, otherwise latex flips out.
        \draw (-5,5) rectangle (5,-6);
    %% Similarly, you can make a circle by specifying the center and then the radius. You can also add a fill color, but if you're printing in black and white you'll probably want to remove that line.
        \draw[fill=white, draw = black] (-1.5,1) circle (3);
        \draw[fill=white, draw = black] (1.5,1) circle (3);
        \draw[fill=white, draw = black] (0,-2) circle (3);
    %% We can use the node command to label points. If you put your cursor on "LARGE" or "textbf" a box will drop down with size and text style options.
